    "problem": "Do you love concerts? Do you wish for a simple concert search engine? Harmonize is here for you. ",
    "solution": "Harmonize allows users to search by artist and location, log in to save favorites or just browse upcoming shows. Simple inteface with no distractions. You can also purchase tickets from third party websites." ,
    "challenges": "Harmonize was my first time working with Firebase. I worked on user authentication and the database to save and delete favorites. I followed the documentation and through trial and error got it to work. Our API also didn't have a filter by location option, so I had to write my own code to extract the location and compare it to teh user input.",
    "functionality": "We spent a couple of days thinking about the user flow through the project. The first thing the user sees is the sign in or skip screen. Whichever one the user chooses, they get redirected to the same home screen. If you are logged in, you can save concerts to favorites, if not, you can only browse. The home page has two search bars, one for artist name, one for location. After the search is performed user recieves all matching results, if they click on a result they will see the map of the venue pop up, and also an option to save concert to favorites or buy tickets.",

    "challenges": "Chewzy was an awesome project for solidifying my API skills. We used Zomato API for the initial search and then the Google Places and Google Details APIs to get more information about the restaurants. It was definitely a challenge passing data and avoiding the errors that pop up from JS being asynchronous. Auth0 was also a new technology for me, so that took a while to get working, but through trial and error I was able to implement Google log in.",
    "functionality": "We came up with a simple algorithm that determines what the user might be in the mood for depending on their answer to fice specific questions. We have 5 question categories, and each contains multiple questions that are randomized with every refresh. Whichever questions gets the highest score makes an API call to the Zomato API with specific cuisine requirements. When an individual restaurant is chosen we use the restaurant name to make an API call to Google Places and Google details to get photos and contact information.",
