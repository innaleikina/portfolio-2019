    "problem": "Have you ever tried to figure out where to go eat? By the time everyone decides what they want, too much time has gone by, and you just have a frozen pizza. Chewzy is here to help you with that first world problem.",
    "solution": "Weâ€™ve got the solution for you! Take a 5 question quic that takes into account your mood and cusine preference and instantly ptovides five results for you to choose from. You can also save restaurants to favorites to try out later.",
    "challenges": "Chewzy was an awesome project for solidifying my API skills. We used Zomato API for the initial search and then the Google Places and Google Details APIs to get more information about the restaurants. It was definitely a challenge passing data and avoiding the errors that pop up from JS being asynchronous. Auth0 was also a new technology for me, so that took a while to get working, but through trial and error I was able to implement Google log in.",
    "functionality": "We came up with a simple algorithm that determines what the user might be in the mood for depending on their answer to fice specific questions. We have 5 question categories, and each contains multiple questions that are randomized with every refresh. Whichever questions gets the highest score makes an API call to the Zomato API with specific cuisine requirements. When an individual restaurant is chosen we use the restaurant name to make an API call to Google Places and Google details to get photos and contact information.",
    "design": "With this color pallette I wanted to keep it simple. Muted main colors and one bright color for highlighting buttons and other clickable elements. The background image is transparent to emphasize that this app is restaurant centered. I also designed the app to flow intuitively, first users get all the results, then they can choose one place that they like. All the contact info is clearly visible "
